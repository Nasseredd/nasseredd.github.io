📝 Bio
---
I am a PhD fellow at the Multispeech team, affiliated with the University of Lorraine, CNRS, and Inria (Loria). My research focuses on developing an objective function to enhance deep neural network (DNN) models for speech enhancement, specifically targeting sensorineural hearing loss. I collaborate closely with the Pasteur Institute (Paris), which contributes to the medical aspects of the project, and CEA (Paris) which focuses on optimizing these models for embedded systems. 

💡 Research Interests
------------------

My broader interests include AI model evaluation, Green and Sustainable AI, aiming to make AI more efficient and environmentally conscious.
